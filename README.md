This repository contains a sample implementation of the matrix folding proof protocol—based on Bulletproofs' improved inner product protocol—developed at the 2022 Clemson University REU in cryptography. The sample implementation is in `src/matrix_folding_proof.rs`, although the other files also contain some modifications (to provide appropriate generators and transcripts). The benchmarking code is in the `benches` folder.
